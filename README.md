# Image Restoration Comparison

Code developed as a supplement for the final paper of the Catholic University of Pernambuco's Computer Science course, 2022.2.

The code implements and executes four different neural network models in the task of denoising images. The dataset used is [Berkeley Segmentation Dataset 500 (BSD500)](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html).

Models:
- Shallow Autoencoder (SA)
- Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDA)
- SegNet
- U-Net
